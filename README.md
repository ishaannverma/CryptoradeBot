The market never sleeps. There always is some opportunity or the other presenting itself, waiting for a taker. One might miss out on such opportunities if they are not paying attention! This is especially true for the cryptocurrency market, which has made and crumbled millionaires. This market never sleeps, literally never closes, and is constantly trading.
In such a situation, if one is paying attention, they are sure to find a market setting of their choice, fit for a perfect trade, every once in a while. However, physically being in front of your screen day-in day-out, waiting for the confluence of the technical indicators of your choice is both draining and wasteful.
